# Research-Internship - Classification Using Transfer Learning
Implemented the research paper of Asst Prof Rishav Singh from NIT Delhi, under his guidance. The aim is to use paradigm of Transfer Learning and outperform the state of the art models. Here the the model(VGG16) a pretrained model is used as a feature extractor. This implementation also aims at providing solutions to a dataset suffering from imbalanced classes. The code implementaion was done on a relatively smaller set of the original dataet(Hardware issues).
